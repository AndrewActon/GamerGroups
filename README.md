# GamerGroups

Gamer Groups is an application designed to connect gamers with like interests. It allows you to add games and genres you play to your profile. It also allows you to search games and view all users who also play that game. Features I plan on adding in the future:
- Messaging
- Search by genre
- Casual or competitive player for given game
- Search filter for casual/competitive
- Looking For Group posts with games to allow for detailed explaination for type of group you are looking for with a given game

Application is written in Swift using Firebase. You will have to load FirbaseAuth and FirebaseFirestore in Xcode to run.
